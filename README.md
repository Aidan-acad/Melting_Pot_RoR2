## Manual Installs ##

No need to mess with the file structure anymore, just unzip into your bepinex/plugins folder.

## Changelog
**0.0.66**

Updated to latest RoR2 Patch, added placeholder sprite for Just a Bucket buff

Fixed invisibile enemies bug, couldn't replicate the lead fetters NRE

Added Just a Bucket, Blood Price, Fluffy Manacles

Fixed issue with thorn cycling damage, loss of scrap vamp perma tracking, added glass shield

Fixed some logs stuck around, tweaked mech mosq bounciness, no updates for at least a week, Im not around.

Haemorrhage stacks from serrated pellets are now permanent, to offset the loss of immediate damage,
For reference per tick each haemorrhage stack does about 1.5x the damage of a bleed stack per game tick.

Serrated pellets now has a minimum bleed requirement of 1, and strips x stacks of bleed to apply haemorrhage, Essentially a base nerf, but should incentivize stacking even more

Serrated Pellets model should now be a sensible size

Hopefully caught the on-death feedback loop stuff

Shield of thorns should no longer proc on self-damage, so no more one-shot repulsor jumps Railgunners :)

Fixed NRE and issues with serrated Pellets not activating. Appropriate drop halos still a work in progress.
Added four new items, item concepts courtesy of EnderGrimm.
Added Item displays for new items, minus serrated pellets (Working on display model atm)

Removed debug log from reverb ring which may have been causing slowdowns lategame.
Reworked net code for scrap vamp, should be more consistent now. Added Mechanical Mosquito - Thanks to EnderGrimm for their input.

Reverb Ring no longer procs on non-generator attacks, looking at you plasma shrimp. Remade Scrap Vamp model.

Swapped out scrap vamp buff icons, added ItemStats and BetterUI support

Sound SFX now should scale properly, reworked lead fetters, buffed echo ring, added new lunar item scrap vamp

Fixed file hierarchy bug

Now updated for Sotv

Reverted Debug values

New Shield of Thorns icon curtosy of SOM. Fixed compat issue with MelT

Fixed item prefab sizes in game being too large
